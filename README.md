# Motivation
Public displays are starting to become more popular every day, but they still have a low interaction rate with the potential users. 
Most of its use is based on advertisement, which, although it’s a revenue for the owner of the display, doesn’t provide all that it could to its potential consumers. 
This types of public spaces are very powerful since they give interactivity and dynamic functionalities to people around it, but the downside is either that the information shown is very generic 
so that it’s useful for everyone that approaches, or it displays too much data so that anyone can find the information they want
